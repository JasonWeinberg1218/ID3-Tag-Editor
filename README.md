# ID3-Tag-Editor

An application that allowed users to view and edit the ID3 tag of various MP3 files, as well as other multimedia file formats. An ID3 tag is a metadata container that stores certain information about multimedia files, such as title, artist, album, and track number, within the files themselves. The user could view/edit the contents of the ID3 tag by passing certain arguments to the application upon execution. This application was written entirely in C within a Linux environment, using the C standard library.
